<hr><h2>2013-05-13 Community Council Response to Hospital development</h2>

<p>The Community Council submission to Angus Council in response to the current planning applications from redevelopment of the former Strathmartine Hospital restates our opposition to any proposal for more than 40 units of housing (as per the local plan) as detrimental to the amenity and environment of the existing community.</p>

<p>Our questionairre on the issue showed 95% opposition to the proposed 198 units of new build and the Community Council submission reflects this clear expression of the views of the community.</p>

<p>Please see the following attachment: <a href="media/201305_LetterEIAM.pdf">201305_LetterEIAM</a></p>

<hr><h2>2011-05-31 </h2>

<p>A 79-metre wind turbine could be put up on farmland north of Dundee, generating cash for the community as well as electricity.</p>

<p>The planning application for the site at Wynton Farm, near Bridgefoot, has come from Hamilton firm Intelligent Land Investment.</p>

<p>The company is also involved in a proposal announced in April for a turbine on agricultural land a few miles away, near Inveraldie.<!--more--></p>

<p>A document supporting its application to Angus Council states that it "focuses on creating planning gain for renewable energy projects" and works closely with landowners to "create commercially viable ventures where all parties benefit."</p>

<p>This includes paying £2500 a year to a community group for the expected 20 to 25-year lifespan of the turbine.</p>

<p>No prospective recipient has been identified at this stage, but the company says it hopes to find a suitable one based with 5km of the Wynton site.</p>

<p>The three-bladed turbine, which would have a 500 kilowatt capacity, is planned for a spot 670m south-east of Wynton farmhouse. The nearest house would be 535m away.</p>

<p>The document, prepared by renewable energy consultants Logan, claims that the turbine would not produce unacceptable levels of noise or shadow flicker.</p>

<p>It notes that there are turbines north of the city and adds, "The closest area, most likely to experience cumulative impact from the turbines, hosts extensive electricity transmission infrastructure.</p>

<p>"The proposed turbine would present a tall but simple, clean structure, unlike the existing pylons.</p>

<p>"For these reasons it is considered that any adverse cumulative impact due to this proposal would not be significantly adverse and would not be sufficient to warrant refusal of this application."</p>
